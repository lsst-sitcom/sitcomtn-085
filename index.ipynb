    "We perform comparison between two strategies of averaging wavefront information encoded in the intensity of defocal point source images. The first approach, “pairing”, is to estimate wavefront based on pairs of intra and extra-focal donuts from each corner wavefront sensor. These individual wavefront estimates per donut pair can be aggregated into eg. mean, and thus conveyed to the optical feedback controller as a per-corner wavefront estimate. Another approach - “stacking” - is to stack donut images in each wavefront sensor before wavefront estimation, thus arriving at a single wavefront estimate from a “stacked” donut image. We compare these two approaches at providing a single wavefront estimate per sensor as a function of donut magnitude, and background.\n",

    "The Optical Path Difference (OPD) is the difference between idealized reference sphere wavefront vs real aberrated wavefront. The OPD returned by phoSim assumes knowledge of the mirror shape, including any perturbations to their surface. By default for the corner wavefront sensors it is evaluated at 4 corners, at mid-point between each sensors. This makes sense as the reference OPD since the average location of all sources taken from each half-sensor would be somewhere in between the two sensors if sources are distributed uniformly. However, to ensure that the differences of estimated wavefront are not due to intrinsic differences of the OPD at different locations, we need to evaluate OPD at sourcve locations. Thus we use exactly the same perturbation `cmd` files as when simulating the stellar grid, but we alter the `inst` files,  outputing images to `iter0/img/opd_grid/` sub-directory.\n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary we performed a series of tests simulating stellar grid on corner sensors consisting of well separated sources of a single magnitude, with or without background.  All simulations were allowed to run via `imgCloseLoop` for the default (5) iterations. We sorted donuts detected at 0th iteration for each intra- and extra-focal sensor by the distance from the center of the field. Of 105 donuts in each sensor, we select 20 nearest to the center of the field into group A, and those 20 farthest away from the center of the field (with highest vignetting) into group B. For each group we stack the donuts, and perform wavefront estimation on such single stacked donut. We also take individual donut pairs from each group, and fit these with `ts_wep` to obtain individual wavefront estimates that were averaged per each group. Thus for each corner sensor and group we compared the averaged to stacked Zernike estimates. We also simulated the optical path difference (OPD), that represents the \"truth\" of the optical system, at the same grid points as the sources. We found thatr the  mean of the OPD at the grid points to the OPD is within few nm to the OPD evaluated at the mid-point between the intra and extra-focal corner sensors (the OPD usually used in the AOS loop). We also tested the gradient in the OPD across the entire source grid, and found it to be <0.05 asec FWHM, i.e. smaller than the difference between group A and B, regardless of whether stacked or averaged.  We found that  with no background there is no magnitude dependence, and the main difference in fit is between different corners and the amount of vignetting. We recommend to maintain the default strategy for wavefront estimation, i.e. averaging individual donut estimates, since we do not find evidence that stacking would perform better (with or without background)."
